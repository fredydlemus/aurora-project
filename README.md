# Welcome to Aurora Project

Hi! I'm Fredy and this is the **Aurora** project, this project is to learn about CI/CD using GitOps implementing various types of workflows with Github Actions, from managing repository task to pass between testing, building, and deploy.

## About this repo
In this repository, you will find a NestJS backend that contains only one default endpoint. However, it serves as a foundation to demonstrate how to implement different workflows to automate various tasks. Examples include backing up a repository to S3 on the administrative side and creating pipelines to publish a new Docker image when a push occurs on the main branch, etc.

> If you believe that can aggregate value to this repo don't hesitate to do it!!!!

Various workflows use reusable workflows that you can find in: [GH repository action templates](https://github.com/fredydlemus/gh-actions-templates)
